# AI-Attendance-System
AI Attendance System is an intelligent attendance management solution that uses computer vision and facial recognition to automate attendance marking. Instead of traditional roll calls or biometric punches, the system captures live video through a camera, detects and identifies faces in real time, and records attendance in a connected database.
